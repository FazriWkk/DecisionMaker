# DecisionMaker
This code will generate a decision for you ;)

# What is DecisionMaker?
Decision maker is a piece of c++ code made by me (obviously),
This code uses a Random Number Generator (RNG) to do its main job, creating decision.
P.S : This code should not be used to make a serious decision such as business, choosing between life and death, or any serious things that can change your life drastically

# Versions
There are 2 files, the ID and the EN.
The ID Files contains an Indonesian version of this code, while the EN contains.. you guessed it, the English version

# Credits
Thank you Google Tone Deaf Bard for helping me make this code, the RNG part only though :)
